    <p>Re: Acct #XXX-XXX-XXXXXXX</p>

    <p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>

    <p>I recently pulled my credit report from Experian and TransUnion and to my amazement, saw that you recently have decided to report me 30 days late on this account in DATE ON REPORT. According to my records not only was I never late on this account, but according to the FCRA, as amended by the FACTA act, you are required to notify me 5 days prior to the insertion of negative listings in my credit report.</p>

    <p>Under the new FACTA laws, you are required to furnish me with documentation regarding information you are reporting to the credit bureaus if I ask for it. I can also to sue you under ยง FCRA 623 (b) for violations of the FCRA if you do not comply.</p>

    <p>ยง 623. (a)(8) ABILITY OF CONSUMER TO DISPUTE INFORMATION DIRECTLY WITH FURNISHER-</p>

    <p>(A) IN GENERAL- The Federal banking agencies, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Commission shall jointly prescribe regulations that shall identify the circumstances under which a furnisher shall be required to reinvestigate a dispute concerning the accuracy of information contained in a consumer report on the consumer, based on a direct request of a consumer.</p>

    <p>In order to clear up this matter, I would like to see, at the very minimum, a payment history from your company showing me the exact dates I was late on these payments. If you don't provide to me within 30 days the information (as is required per the FCRA), I will assume you have no documentation and therefore you were negligent in providing the credit bureaus with accurate information.</p>

    <p>To avoid a lawsuit, I request that you remove the late payments from my credit report and report Paid As Agreed. Though I am entitled to $3,000, $1000 for each violation (one for each inaccurate late payment on my account for each credit bureau) I will settle for you correcting this inforamation, unless you refuse. Please correct this listing to "paid as agreed - never late", and remove late for <insert date of late(s)>, or I will be forced to seek legal action.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,<br>
    <strong>Your name</strong></p>
