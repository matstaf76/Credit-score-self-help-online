                <p><span class="bold-and-large">Your Credit Report</span></p>
                <p>This is a detailed record of your credit history. It includes information about your loans, credit cards, and payment habits. It’s like a financial resume that shows how responsible you’ve been with money.</p>
                
                <br><p><span class="bold-and-large">Your Credit Score</span></p>
                <p>This is a number between 300 and 850 that represents your creditworthiness. The higher the number, the better. It’s like a financial health score that lenders use to decide if they should lend you money.</p>
                
                <br><p><span class="bold-and-large">The Credit Bureaus</span></p>
                <p>These are organizations (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax) that collect and maintain your credit information. They’re like detectives that keep track of your financial behavior.</p>
                
                <br><p><span class="bold-and-large">Lenders</span></p>
                <p>These are banks or other financial institutions that lend money. They’re like judges who use your credit report and score to decide if they should lend you money and at what terms you should be offered.</p>
                
                <br><p><span class="bold-and-large">Remember</span></p><p>The system is in place to charge you money. It helps to pay your bills on time and don't borrow more money than you can pay back so the you can maintain a low <a href="debt-to-income_ratio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEBT TO INCOME RATIO.</a> and a low <a href="credit_utilization_ratio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CREDIT UTILIZATION RATIO.</a> This will help you acheive and maintain a high credit score</p>
