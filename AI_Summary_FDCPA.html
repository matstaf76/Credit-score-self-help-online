                </li>
                <li><strong>Attorney’s Fees and Costs</strong>: If you win your lawsuit, the court may require the debt collector to pay your attorney’s fees and court costs. This provision is designed to encourage consumers to take legal action without worrying about the cost of hiring an attorney.</li>
                <li><strong>Factors Considered by the Court</strong>: When determining the amount of damages, the court will consider several factors, including:

                </li>
                <li><strong>Good Faith Defense</strong>: Debt collectors may have a defense if they can show that the violation was unintentional and resulted from a bona fide error, despite having procedures in place to avoid such errors. This is known as the “bona fide error” defense.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Administrative Enforcement (§ 814)</strong>: This section details how the Act is enforced by federal agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</li>

        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Relation to State Laws (§ 816)</strong>: This section explains how the Act interacts with state laws. If a state law provides greater protection to consumers, it will take precedence over the FDCPA.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Exemption for State Regulation (§ 817)</strong>: This section allows states to regulate debt collection practices as long as their regulations are consistent with the FDCPA.</li>
