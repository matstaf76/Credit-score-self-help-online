    <p>To whom it may concern:</p>

    <p>I am writing to dispute information in my credit report and this letter is a request for assistance.  It has come to my attention that information being reported in my credit file is inaccurate and misleading. As a credit reporting agency you are governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which is supposed to protect consumers from inaccurate, unverifiable or invalidated information reporting of their credit file.</p>
    <p>According to the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Section 1692g(a), a debtor has 30 days to dispute the validity of a debt.  If the creditor cannot provide sufficient evidence that the debtor was given adequate notice, the debtor must be given another 30-day debt-validation period, and the creditor must provide evidence that the debtor is liable for the account in question. The only notice I have ever received about these alleged debts was in my credit report itself after I was denied credit. </p>
    <p>I formally dispute these debts and request the following items be thoroughly investigated and deleted:
        <br>(Company), (Account Number), (Amount) Basis for Dispute,
        <br>(Company), (Account Number), (Amount) Basis for Dispute,
        </p>
    <!-- Add the rest of your letter content here -->

    <p>Upon completion of your investigation please send a description of the procedures used to determine the accuracy of the account(s) I am disputing, as well as the name and contact information of the agent conducting said investigation in case further communication is necessary.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
